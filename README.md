## Welcome to my GitHub profile! ##
My name is Julian and I recently completed an advanced data analytics bootcamp with [neue fische](www.neuefische.de), where I gained expertise in various aspects of data analysis. 

I am proficient in data cleaning, data visualization, and working with tools such as Python (including pandas, numpy, seaborn, and scikit-learn), SQL, and Tableau.

Feel free to [explore](https://github.com/Jappler85/my_projects) some of my repositories and projects, where I showcase my data analytics capabilities and my passion for turning raw data into actionable insights. 

Let's connect and collaborate on data-driven projects to make a real impact together!
